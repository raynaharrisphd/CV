I am interested in the opportunity to contribute as a Yoga Instructor at Palisades Yoga, where the community, instructors, and location create an ideal environment for sharing the practice of yoga. With two years of teaching experience through the Courage Project and an additional year at Tahoe Flow Arts and Fitness, I feel prepared to lead engaging and mindful classes. I would be happy to take on a regular class, such as Restore & Flow or Hatha Flow, and Iâ€™m also available to substitute for Candlelight Vinyasa and Yoga for Strength as needed.
